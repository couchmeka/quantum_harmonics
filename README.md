## Features

- **Quantum-Music Interactions**  
  Analyze the relationship between quantum states and musical harmonics using Western 12-tone and Pythagorean tuning systems.

- **Quantum Error Correction (QEC)**  
  Explore QEC codes (e.g., 5-Qubit Code) under various conditions to understand fidelity improvements and state stability.

- **Fluid Dynamics Simulations**  
  Study velocity fields, pressure distributions, and quantum-classical resonance effects in fluid systems.

- **Pattern Analysis**  
  Utilize machine learning techniques for clustering and identifying patterns across quantum, musical, and fluid datasets.

- **Intuitive Visualizations**  
  Leverage interactive dashboards for insights into quantum circuits, frequency ratios, phase dynamics, and more.

## Works in Progress

- **Particle Simulator**  
  Developing a **particle simulator** to model quantum and classical particle interactions within fluid environments.

- **UI Enhancements**  
  Improving user experience with a more streamlined and intuitive interface.

- **Debugging**  
  Actively refining functionality and fixing bugs to ensure a smooth and reliable application.
